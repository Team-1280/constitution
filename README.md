## Preamble

This constitution is Team 1280’s official governing text, and it outlines the
rules and regulations that all members must adhere to. The constitutions for
most robotics teams and other organizations are designed to take away your
freedom to innovate, revolutionize, and change, in favor of nebulous goals. By
contrast, the Team 1280 Constitution is intended to guarantee your freedom
within the club and team–to make sure it remains free for all its members. When
we refer to the term ‘free’ in this document, we refer to free as in ‘free
speech’, not ‘free beer’. We, the members of Team 1280, in order to promote the
development of robotics and STEM education in the SRVHS community, hereby
establish this constitution to define our standard procedures, safeguards, and
ensure the freedom of all members.
